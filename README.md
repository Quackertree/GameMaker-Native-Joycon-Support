# GameMaker-Native-Joycon-Support

This is an extension for Game Maker Studio 1.4, including source, which allows you to pair your Joycon to your Windows machine and read the input from it.

Note: This is made for homebrews who want to toy with the Joycon. Therefore, the input received from the Joycon may not be perfect. If you seek perfect synchronisation, get an actual Nintendo Dev Account.

Credit to: https://github.com/mfosse/JoyCon-Driver/blob/master/joycon-driver/src/main.cpp for figuring out a lot of stuff, allowing me to put it together in a DLL for GM:S.
